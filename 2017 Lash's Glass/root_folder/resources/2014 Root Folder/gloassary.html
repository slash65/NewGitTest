  	<h2>Glazer Glossary</h2>
    <p>
    	<strong>Glass</strong><br />
        A hard, brittle, noncrystalline, more or less transparent substance produced by fusion, usually consisting of mutually dissolved silica and silicates that also contain soda and lime, as in the ordinary variety used for windows and bottles.
    </p>
    <p>
    	<strong>Glazier</strong><br />
        A professionally trained glass or window installer.
    </p>
    <p>
    	<strong>Single Pane</strong><br />
        Single Pane windows contain just a single pane of glass, generally ranging from1/16&quot;-1/4&quot; as opposed to dual pane and triple panes, which have two panes or three panes of glass glazed together.  A single pane window is generally a wood, aluminum, or steel window, and can be glazed a variety of ways depending on the original window manufacturer.  
	</p>
    <p>
    	<strong>Insulated Glass</strong><br />
        Also known as Insulated Units, Dual pane, I.G. or I.U. or triple pane glass refers to multiple pieces of glass, with anywhere from ¼ to ¾ of airspace between panes, that are glued together to keep an air space between the panes of glass.  What this does is insulate the glass, so that warm/cold air and condensation cannot pass through the glass as easily.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are a variety of different options available with replacement insulated glass, from extra insulation added to the spacer bar that gives the air space between the panes of glass, to using argon gas between the panes instead of regular air.  Argon is a denser gas, helping to keep heat in in the winter, and to minimize vibration transference, keeping your house or business quieter on the inside to street noise outside.</p>
          <p>  There are also options to add barely noticeable metallic coatings on one surface of the glass, called low-e treatment, that helps to minimize heat transference, keeping your house warmer in the winter, and cooler in the summer.
	</p>
    <p>
    	<strong>Wood Windows</strong><br />
        On most wood single pane windows, there would be a putty glaze put around the edge of the glass to cover the glass edges, and once painted will help to keep water from entering the wood window, causing rot, swelling, and mold.  Unpainted putty will still help to keep water out, but will allow some water through, will eventually crack due to exposure to the weather and sun, and will generally be a dull gray color that won't match most windows.
    </p>
    <p>
    	<strong>Steel Windows</strong><br />
        During the 50's in America there were quite a few steel windows installed, with the promise of being stronger, longer lasting, and more forgiving than wood.  Many steel single-pane windows were a putty glaze, much like wood windows.  There are generally a steel spring that attach's to the inner window frame (where the glass sits) to hold the glass, while the glazing putty is applied.  Most steel windows were either stationary picture windows or a crank out window of some type.
	</p>
    <p>
    	<strong>Aluminum Windows</strong><br />
Aluminum windows were the next step in window evolution, and this is where window manufacturers started to vary the installation of glass into the window frames.  There are some aluminum windows build in the late 50's and early 60's that were strictly crankout and picture windows, almost identical to most steel windows from the 50's.  the main difference were instead of using a putty glaze to seal off the edges of the glass, the windows would use an aluminum snap bead.  With the snap bead the need to paint the putty was eliminated, meaning less work for the homeowner after a window repair.
<p>
Aluminum windows also introduced the use of a rubber gasket set, introduced slider windows, and brought back the single hung windows with the use of block and tackle balancers.  Rubber gasket set windows requires the removal of a section of the window frame (the section surrounding the glass), to remove the frame from the glass, pull off the gasket, and then re glaze the new glass with either the same gasket or a new gasket if the old gaskets condition is deteriorating.  The rubber gasket system evolved with the window companies, and was used in many dual-pane aluminum as well.  The gasket set is still used in some aluminum windows, but not in the use of vinyl windows.  
    </p>
    <p>
    	<strong>Vinyl Windows</strong><br />
        Vinyl windows have a lot of similarities to quite a few aluminum windows.  95% of vinyl windows are similar in the glass glazing techniques, which are usually having a vinyl snap bead, either on the outside of the window or the inside (one of the main variants between manufacturers), to cover the glass edge and give the window a finished look.  The glass is generally installed using a 1/16" thick foam double sided type, that adheres to one side of the vinyl, and and to the glass with the other side. 
<p>
 The sliders are all very similar as well, with most windows have a duplex style rollers (meaning two wheels per set, totaling four wheels per slider), a vertical channel that interlocks with the center jamb of the window, providing a solid feel, and creating an interlock  with weatherstripping, keeping out air, water, and bugs.  
<p>
The single hungs are also all very similar, with block and tackle style balancers on either side.  The vents (sliding section of the window) have a clip that catches onto the balancer, letting the balancers guide the vent up or down, and then has spring pressure determined to be appropriated to the weight of the vent, to hold the vent in place when the window is open, that way gravity doesn't just shut the window for you.
    </p>
    <p>
    	<strong>Block Frame</strong><br />
	A block frame window has no fin protruding from the edge of the window.  The window is essentially a rectangular-cube. Usual application would be wood window retro-fit or brick/cinderblock application.
    </p>
    <p>
    	<strong>Nail-Fin Frame</strong><br />
        A nail-fin frame is used on new construction application.  The nail fin is located around the perimeter of the window, uaully 2/3 of the way from the inside edge. 
	</p>
    <p>
    	<strong>Flush-Fin Frame</strong><br />
        A flush-fin frame has a fin on the outside edge of the window, around the entire perimeter.  The flush fin is usually used for retro-fit windows, an installation that minimizes the need for stucco repair.
